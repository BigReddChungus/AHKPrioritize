# AHKPrioritize

Note: This is NOT perfect, it can mess up if areas of the search zone contain pixels of the similar color. I've noticed it snap to sand mines and farms. If it is selecting the wrong thing, try adjusting your pixel search area or rotating your camera so your view changes and the pixel doesn't get picked up.
Usage:

You will need to change the coordinates of the Relocate.ahk and PrioritizePixelSearch.ahk files and use the GetMouseCoordinates.ahk file to determine the coordinates of the the upper and lower region (Y-axis) as well as the Width of it (X-axis) of the Prioritize Box as well as the building relocate button. Otherwise you will pick up pixels on the screen that are of the similar color, but since we tell it the coordinates to search in, it will only pick up pixels in that search area, meaning we identify the pixel range of the box we want to click.

So you would want to find the coordiantes of these boxes and make sure that you're only searching in this area for the pixels you want to snap the mouse to and click on.

Prioritize Box Example:
I have specified the coordinates for this box, I foudn it using the GetMouseCoordinates AHK tool and clicked on the areas of the box to find the zone it's in, so in the file PrioritizePixelSearch.ahk the coordinates for this area are 1760-1815 for the x-axis, and 640-647 for the y axis. You will need to change these values for your own screen/HUD-size/resolution

Relocate Building Example:

Same thing as above, but the x-axis coordinates are between 1800-1860 for me and 200-385 for the y-axis
The area will vary depending on hud size.
